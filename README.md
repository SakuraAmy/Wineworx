## Project Description:
Decide to support the local Deaf-owned wine making busniess called Wineworx by updating their website to be user friendly with less complicated navigation and more balance of content and visual. 

## Feature
- First, every page of a website will be redesigned with a new layout. They will be easy to read and provide an excellent visual on each section. The website will have a good responsive web design for three different browser widths.
- Update the user interaction with new navigation and sitemap on a website. It eliminates the users from getting lost in a website. Call to action sections will be placed to assist the users to travel from page to page. Adding the sitemap is essential for Search Engine Optimizations (SEO) that can help Wineworx’s pages be found on Search Engines such as Google and Bing.
- Improve the user interactions on a form by creating a pop-up alert window to guide the users to be aware of their errors or process in the form. Also, the form will be added with a loading screen indicating that the form is loading. The form will be scalable and accessible for blind and low-vision users.
- Build the brand consistency across all pages by logos, symbols, colors, styles, and typography. It serves an expression of a successful business that customers will trust and build loyalty upon it. It also allows the business to follow the brand guidelines to build a new page in the future.
